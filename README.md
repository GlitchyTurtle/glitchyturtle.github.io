## GlitchyTurtle Dev

This is just a site for my most updated packs. You can see most of them quickly on [MCPE DL](https://mcpedl.com/user/glitchyturtle32/), but more updated versions and others that you can't find there will be here (with safe downloads!)

# Addons

### Avatar Addon

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GlitchyTurtle/glitchyturtle.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
